# What is Kubernetes how can I use it?

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Kubernetes is a platform for managing containerized workloads and services. that make easy declarative configuration and automation.

## Overview

Kubernetes works in a cluster, consisting of a set of worker machines, these machines are called nodes, that run containerized applications, and every cluster has at least one worker node.

Also, a Kubernetes cluster has a control plane, it manages the worker nodes and the cluster state.

These are the various components that you need to have for a complete and working Kubernetes cluster.

The components of a Kubernetes cluster by kubernetes.io

In my opinion, this section is very important, mainly if you want to have a differential in your career, and this knowledge will help me a lot in many situations to solve problems.

Sometimes we only have an interest in knowing how works the motor of a car when we have a problem on the highway and the car

## Kubernetes Control Plane Components

The Control Plane manages the cluster state. It makes decisions about the cluster, for example, increasing the number of pod replicas or scheduling something.

- kuber-api - is the central point of communication from the Kubernetes cluster it is the front end of the Kubernetes control plane.
- etcd - it's basically the store used for Kubernetes for all cluster data. Make sure you have a backup plan for your etcd.
- kube-scheduler - It is responsible for watching newly created pods, checking what are available nodes and assigning the pods created for the available node.
- kube-controll-manager - runs controller process. It is responsible for cluster orchestration.

The Control Plane must not run any pods

## Nodes Components

The node components are in every node of the cluster, they are responsible for maintaining the pods running and providing the Kubernetes runtime environment.

- Kubelet - is a node agent, that manages the state of nodes, so it receives the control plane commands
- kube-proxy - It manages the network and network resources of nodes and redirects to containers.
- Container runtime - this component enables the Kubernetes to run containers.

## Let's install a K8s Cluster

Before you follow this step, [please install the Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) according to your environment

https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/

For this series, let's prepare an environment for you to follow the examples.

For now, let's prepare a local environment to focus only on the fundamentals at the end of the series, we will together create a Kubernetes cluster like a production environment.

There are many options to create a K8s locally

- Minikube
- Kind
- k3d

I've been using Kind and it has been serving me

Let's use the mode of Multi-node clusters

```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
  - role: worker
  - role: worker
  - role: worker
```

Basically, we're talking to Kind, "Please, create for me, a cluster with 4 machines. 1 Control Plane and 3 workers nodes"

Now, run the command in your terminal:

```bash
kind create cluster --config kind-config.yml --name programmingonmars
```

You should have this result below

![Kubernetes Terminal Output](/articles/images/kubernetes_terminal_output.png)

To use your k8s cluster, run the command below

```bash
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-programmingonmars
```

Now we're connected in our k8s cluster!

![Kubernetes Cluster Creation](/articles/images/kubernetes_cluster_creation.png)

Let's check the nodes using the command:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

This is so cool we created 3 works and 1 control plane as we declared in the kind-config.yml

![Kubernetes Get Nodes](/articles/images/kubernetes_get_nodes.png)

## How Kind Works?

[Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes".
kind was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI.

SÃ³, if we run the command:

```bash
docker container ls
```

We can see 4 containers running

Now you're ready to start your new journey in the Kubernetes world, let's run a First Application on Kubernetes
